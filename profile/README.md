# Welcome to Li Peng's Org

Hi, I'm Li Peng, a graduate from Dalian University of Technology. And my major is Network Engineering. I come from Chongqing, the mountain city.

You can call me Lean and my personal blog is http://www.penglean.com. 

I like sharing my experience with others.

Hope we can become friends in the future!

This is me in 2021:
